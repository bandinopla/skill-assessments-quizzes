In MATLAB, the `imfilter` command performs a convolution operation between an image and a matrix. Suppose you have an image loaded in MATLAB into the variable `img` and you apply the following code. The original image appears slightly blurred because the convolution smoothed out the image (removed noise). Why do you think this happened?\n\n```\nh = ones(5,5)/25;\nimshow(imfilter(img,h));\n```\n\n-  `h` is a Gaussian filter that adds to 1. Its intended effect is to highlight image edges.\n-  `h` is an averaging filter uniformly distributed that adds to 1. Its intended effect is to smooth out images (remove noise).\n-  `h` is a Laplacian filter that adds up to 0. Its intended effect is to smooth out images (remove noise).\n-  `imfilter` is a function that always blurs the images.\n\n","options":3,"answer":1},{"text":"#### Q59.
