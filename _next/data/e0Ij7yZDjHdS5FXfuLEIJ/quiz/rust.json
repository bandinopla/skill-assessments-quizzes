However it may not cpexists with any other references. and may be created only in single-threaded code.\n-  `UnsafeCell<T>` provides thread-safety. Therefore, creating `&T` references from multiple threads is safe.\n-  The only safe operation is the `.get()` method, which returns only a raw pointer.\n-  Non. `UnsafeCell<T>` only allows code that would otherwise need unsafe blocks to be written in safe code.\n\n[Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html)\n\n","options":3,"answer":2},{"text":"#### Q35.
