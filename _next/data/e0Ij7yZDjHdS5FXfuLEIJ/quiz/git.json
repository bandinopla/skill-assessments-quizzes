How can you check your current git version?\n\n-  git --v\n-  git --version\n-  git --option\n-  git --current\n\n","options":3,"answer":1},{"text":"#### Q2. What command lets you create a connection between a local and remote repository?\n\n-  git remote add new\n-  git remote add origin\n-  git remote new origin\n-  git remote origin\n\n[Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20291731/how-to-connect-to-a-remote-git-repository)\n\n","options":3,"answer":1},{"text":"#### Q3. Describe what these Git commands do to the commit history:\n\n```bash\ngit reset --hard HEAD~5\ngit merge --squash HEAD@{1}\n```\n\n-  They reset the HEAD to the fifth commit in the repo, then merge to the master branch.\n-  The current branch's HEAD is reset back five commits, then prior commits are squashed into a single commit.\n-  They delete the last five commits.\n-  They merge the last five commits into a new branch.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- `git reset --hard HEAD~5` resets the current branch to the commit just before the last 5 (see `man gitrevisions` for details about this notation and other cool alternatives like `HEAD@{2 days ago}`). As it is a hard reset, it will also overwrite every change in the working tree as well. See `man git-reset`.\n- `git merge --squash HEAD@{1}` HEAD@{1} is where the branch was just before the previous command (again, see `man gitrevisions`). This command sets the state of the index to be as it would just after a merge from that commit. This whole operation could be a way to take 5 commits from a branch in which you started a new feature and squash them to a single commit, a meaningful one.\n\n","options":3,"answer":1},{"text":"#### Q4. Your current project has several branches; master, beta, and push-notifications. You've just finished the notification feature in the push-notification branch, and you want to commit it to beta branch. How can you accomplish this?\n\n-  Checkout the push-notifications branch and run git merge beta\n-  Checkout the master branch and run git merge beta -> push-notification\n-  Delete the push-notification branch and it will be committed to the master branch automatically\n-  Checkout the beta branch and run git merge push-notification\n\n","options":3,"answer":3},{"text":"#### Q5. Which of the following is true you when you use the following command?\n\n`git add -A`\n\n-  All new and updated files are staged\n-  Files are staged in alphabetical order.\n-  All new files are staged\n-  Only updated files are staged\n\n","options":3,"answer":0},{"text":"#### Q6. What will the following command print to the Terminal?\n\n`git remote -v`\n\n-  A list of remote repositories and their URLs\n-  The current git version you're running\n-  An inline editor for modifying remote repositories\n-  The last 5 git versions you've installed\n\n","options":3,"answer":0},{"text":"#### Q7. Looking at the following commands, describe what is happening.\n\n```bash\ngit checkout feature-user-location\ngit cherry-pick kj2342134sdf090093f0sdgasdf99sdfo992mmmf9921231\n```\n\n-  The commit is being tagged for release on the feature-user-location branch\n-  A commit is being copied from its original branch over to the feature-user-location branch\n-  The commit is being cherry picked as the new HEAD of the commit history\n-  A commit is being copied from the feature-user-location branch to the master branch\n-  The branch is switched to the feature-user-location branch, and the specified commit is applied to the branch.\n\n**Explanation:** Commits aren't copied when cherry picking, they are cherry picked. The changes introduced by the commit are applied and a new commit is then created. This allow us to get specific changes as if they were patches (in the GIT's book, this is actually called [Patching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C:-Git-Commands-Patching \"See this in the GIT's book\")). As a new commit is created upon feature-user-location, HEAD also changes to match it. You can see this in `cat .git/HEAD` and `cat .git/refs/heads/feature-user-location` for this case. See `man git-cherry-pick` for details.\n\n**NOTE**: There are two versions of this question so far. The task is always \"describe what is happening\", the commands are always a `checkout` and a `cherry-pick`, and the correct answer is always the same.\n\n","options":4,"answer":2},{"text":"#### Q8. What does the following command do to the git repository?\n\n`git reset --soft HEAD^`\n\n-  It deletes all previous commits and reset the repository history back to its initial state.\n-  It resets the working branch to the first commit.\n-  It keeps the HEAD at the current commit, but clears all previous commits.\n-  It sets HEAD to the previous commit and leaves changes from the undone commit in the stage/index.\n\n","options":3,"answer":3},{"text":"#### Q9. You find a bug in your project, but can't locate where it was introduced in the commit history. How would you diagnose this problem?\n\n-  Manually backtrack through your commit history.\n-  Use git search -diff to compare all commits in your repository history.\n-  Run a git rebase to find the buggy commit.\n-  Use git bisect to compare the buggy commit to an early commit that works as expected.\n\n","options":3,"answer":3},{"text":"#### Q10.

How could you squash multiple commits together without using git merge --squash?\n\n-  Caching\n-  You can't. git merge --squash is the only git command for that operation.\n-  Rebasing\n-  Reflogging\n\n","options":3,"answer":2},{"text":"#### Q14. If you cloned an existing git repository, what would happen?\n\n-  A new copy would overwrite the central repository\n-  A copy of the repository would be created on your local machine\n-  Nothing, cloning is not a supported git function\n-  A copy of the repository would be created on the hosting platform\n\n","options":3,"answer":1},{"text":"#### Q15. How can you display a list of files added or modified in a specific commit?\n\n-  Find the commit in the remote repository, as that's the only place that kind of information is stored.\n-  Use the `diff-tree` command with the commit hash.\n-  Run `git commit --info` with the commit hash.\n-  Access the commit stash data with `git stash`.\n\n","options":3,"answer":1},{"text":"#### Q16.

Hence `# .swift` does not do anything. See `man gitignore`.\n\n","options":3,"answer":2},{"text":"#### Q17. After you make changes to a local repository, you run the following command.
