In the context of OOP, what is composition?\n\n- %OPTION% Composition is the act of one object passing to another object an operation to be performed on behalf of the initial object.\n- %OPTION% Composition is a part/hole relationship where an object is composed of one or more other objects, each of which is considered a part of the whole.\n- %OPTION% Composition is a binding where the class/name association is not made until the object designated by the name is created at execution time\n- %OPTION% Composition is a process of collecting classes that provide a set of services for a particular domain\n\n","options":3,"answer":1},{"text":"#### Q80. Static polymorphism uses method \\_ ?\n\n- %OPTION% overloading\n- %OPTION% inheritance\n- %OPTION% abstraction\n- %OPTION% overriding\n\n","options":3,"answer":0},{"text":"#### Q81. What does a concrete class not have?\n\n- %OPTION% parents\n- %OPTION% pure virtual functions\n- %OPTION% attributes\n- %OPTION% purposes\n\n","options":3,"answer":1},{"text":"#### Q82. How does dynamic typing complicate troubleshooting?\n\n- %OPTION% It can be difficult to identify variables that are incorrectly typed\n- %OPTION% The dynamic variables can assume only limited values\n- %OPTION% Storage is fixed for dynamic variables\n- %OPTION% Static variables are more flexible than dynamic variables\n\n","options":3,"answer":0},{"text":"#### Q83. What is the difference between early binding and late binding?\n\n- %OPTION% Early binding is when a variable is assigned a value when a scope is created. Late binding is when a variable is assigned a value after a scope is exited\n- %OPTION% Early binding is when a variable is assigned a value when the program starts. Late binding is when a variable is assigned after the program is running\n- %OPTION% There is no difference. In both cases, variables are assigned values when a program has completed startup and is running\n- %OPTION% Early binding is when a variable is assigned its value at compile time. Late binding is when a variable is assigned a value at run time\n\n","options":3,"answer":3},{"text":"#### Q84. What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?\n\n- %OPTION% Interfaces can contain code or data. Abstract classes do not contain code or data. A class can inherit from more than one abstract class but can only implement one interface\n- %OPTION% Interfaces can contain code or data. Abstract classes do not contain code or data. A class can inherit from only one abstract class but can implement an unlimited number of interface\n- %OPTION% Abstract classes can contain code or data. Interface do not contain code or data. A class can inherit from only one abstract class but can implement an unlimited number of interfaces\n- %OPTION% Abstract classes can contain code or data. Interface do not contain code or data. A class can inherit from more than one abstract class but can only implement one interface\n\n","options":3,"answer":2},{"text":"#### Q85. What parameters are required to be passed to a class constructor?\n\n`Here they haven't mentioned any specific language so let's consider all languages.`\n\n- %OPTION% reference to subclass // References to subclass are never required as you can simply Initialize subclass & use their object.\n- %OPTION% reference to base class // References to the base class are not required in Java, Javascript & Python\n- %OPTION% reference to this pointer // While Python & Javascript may require passing this or self in the constructor, It is not passed in Java constructor.\n- %OPTION% none // Above 3 are incorrect so \"none\" is the answer\n\n","options":3,"answer":3},{"text":"#### Q86. What are the four principles of object-oriented programming?\n\n- %OPTION% manipulation, encapsulation, inheritance, and dependency inversion\n- %OPTION% dependency inversion, open/closed principle, encapsulation, and inheritance\n- %OPTION% interface segregation, abstraction, dependency inversion, and inheritance\n- %OPTION% abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism\n\n","options":3,"answer":3},{"text":"#### Q87. From the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming, which statement best describes the Liskov substitution principle?\n\n- %OPTION% A class should have only a single responsibility—that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.\n- %OPTION% Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n- %OPTION% Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.\n- %OPTION% objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.\n\n","options":3,"answer":3},{"text":"#### Q88. In addition to responsabilities, what should be listed on Class-responsability-collaboration (CRC) cards?\n\n- %OPTION% which programming language will be used.\n- %OPTION% the programmer responsible for implementation.\n- %OPTION% interacting classes.\n- %OPTION% attributes.\n\n","options":3,"answer":3}],"title":"## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)"},"lang":"en","availableLanguages":[{"isSelected":true,"name":"English","key":"en"}],"dictionary":{"en":{"CHEER":"ALRIGHT!
