Calling FailNow does not stop those other goroutines.  \nRun runs f as a subtest of t called name. It runs f in a separate goroutine and blocks until f returns or calls t.Parallel to become a parallel test. Run reports whether f succeeded (or at least did not fail before calling t.Parallel).  \nRun may be called simultaneously from multiple goroutines, but all such calls must return before the outer test function for t returns.\n\n","options":3,"answer":2},{"text":"#### Q31.
