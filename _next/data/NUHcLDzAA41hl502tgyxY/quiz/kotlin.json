You are attempting to assign an integer variable to a long variable, but Kotlin compiler flags it as an error. Why?\n\n-  You must wrap all implicit conversion in a try/catch block\n-  You can only assign `Long` to an `Int`, not the other way around\n-  There is no implicit conversion from `Int` to `Long`\n-  All integers in Kotlin are of type `Long`\n\n[reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-types.html#explicit-conversions)\n\n","options":3,"answer":2},{"text":"#### Q11.
