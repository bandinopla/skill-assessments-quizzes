In which of these situations are interfaces better than abstract classes?\n\n-  When you need to define an object type's characteristics, use an interface. When you need to define an object type's capabilities, use an abstract class.\n-  Interfaces are a legacy of older versions of C#, and are interchangeable with the newer abstract class feature.\n-  When you need a list of capabilities and data that are classes-agnostic, use an interface.
