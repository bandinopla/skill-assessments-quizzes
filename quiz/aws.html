How do you correct this problem?\n\n- %OPTION% Use the RDS console to force a reboot of the database instance so that the primary server becomes the master server again.\n- %OPTION% The server running the .NET utilities is caching the DNS lookup on the database cluster address. Flush the DNS cache of the server and force the C# utilities to open new connections to the database.\n- %OPTION% A.NET application will retain the IP address of a connection string until the host machine is rebooted.\n- %OPTION% The NET utilities need to change the SQL Server endpoint in the connection strings to read from the secondary database server using a try/catch.\n\n","options":3,"answer":3},{"text":"#### Q4.

For your AWS root account, you have generated a random password of the maximum allowed length and included special characters. Which additional steps should you take to secure your AWS root account?\n\n- %OPTION% Create an AM role for the account administrator with the highest privileges. Do not store the root password, but when the root account is needed reset the password on the root account via email confirmation and repeat this procedure.\n- %OPTION% Store your randomly generated password in your organizational secrets database using a service such as 1Password or LastPass, and only grant access to this secret to the DevOps team.\n- %OPTION% Create IAM accounts for your administrators and attach the AdministratorAccess policy to their accounts. Disable the root account in the user settings.\n- %OPTION% Create an IAM role for the account administrator with the highest privileges and do not use the root account in day-today operations.

Enable Multi-AZ support and select the Mirroring/Always On option. Select another region for the mirroring option.\n- %OPTION% You can not set up an active-active architecture for SQL Server that spans geographic regions.\n\n[Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html?opt_id=oeu1612780272452r0.9199525073583283)\n\n","options":3,"answer":2},{"text":"#### Q10. What does it cost to launch an EC2 instance from the AWS Marketplace?\n\n- %OPTION% All images in the AWS Marketplace incur additional hourly fees in addition to the charges from the instance size you select.\n- %OPTION% You can only launch images that were created by other users on your AWS account, so you pay only for the instance size you select and the S3 storage costs for the base image.\n- %OPTION% Each image has its own pricing that could either be free, or include charges for software licensing costs.
