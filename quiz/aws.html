Your database is an RDS instance running SQL Server with Multi-AZ replication and you have several older .NET console utilities that perform database operations every 15 seconds.

How do you correct this problem?\n\n-  Use the RDS console to force a reboot of the database instance so that the primary server becomes the master server again.\n-  The server running the .NET utilities is caching the DNS lookup on the database cluster address. Flush the DNS cache of the server and force the C# utilities to open new connections to the database.\n-  A.NET application will retain the IP address of a connection string until the host machine is rebooted.\n-  The NET utilities need to change the SQL Server endpoint in the connection strings to read from the secondary database server using a try/catch.\n\n","options":3,"answer":3},{"text":"#### Q4.

What does it cost to launch an EC2 instance from the AWS Marketplace?\n\n-  All images in the AWS Marketplace incur additional hourly fees in addition to the charges from the instance size you select.\n-  You can only launch images that were created by other users on your AWS account, so you pay only for the instance size you select and the S3 storage costs for the base image.\n-  Each image has its own pricing that could either be free, or include charges for software licensing costs. You will also pay for the instance the image runs on\n-  All images in the AWS Marketplace contain only open-source software with no additional fees and are created by other AWS users.

When using AWS for research and development ahead of a planned migration, how do you prevent unexpected increases or spikes in the billing?\n\n-  Use the billing dashboard to create a cost budget. Input the max amount you want to be charged each month. Any charges that occur over this amount will cause AWS to automatically suspend those resources\n-  Using the root AWS account, activate IAM access to the billing information for the account. Make sure your IAM users have the Billing FullAccessGroup policy. Then from the billing dashboard, check the accrued charges once a day.\n-  If you are using the AWS free tier, you will have to confirm the usage of any service that goes over the AWS free tier limits.\n-  Using the root AWS account enable Billing Alerts in the user preferences.

Set the retention policy on the object to one hour and email this link to\n      the user. The link will be active for one hour.\n-  Create a public S3 bucket. Use a hash of the user's email address and the date and time the report was requested to generate a\n      unique object name. Email this link to the user and have a scheduled task run within your application to remove objects that are older\n      than seven days.\n-  Create a private S3 bucket. The link in the email should take the user to your application, where you can verify the active user\n      session or force the user to log in. After verifying the user has rights to access this file, have the application retrieve the object\n      from S3 and return it in the HTTP response. Delete the file from the S3 bucket after the request is completed.\n-  Create a private S3 bucket. The link in the email should take the user to your application, where you can verify the active user\n      session or force the user to log in. Set the report object in S3 to public. Show the user a \"Download\" button in the browser that links\n      to the public object.\n\n","options":3,"answer":2},{"text":"#### Q69.

You have an analytics suite that produces reports about the usage patterns of your web application. After completing your migration to AWS and using Application Load Balancer to balance the load across your web application, your marketing department noticed that location-based reports on the web traffic only show traffic originating from a single location. What is the problem?\n\n-  Use a Classic Load Balancer, not Application Load Balancer.\n-  Application Load Balancer does not preserve the original source IP address. The analytics software needs to be configured to look at the 'X-Forwarded-For' HTTP request header for the correct source IP address.\n-  Application Load Balencer has to be configured to retain the source IP address of the traffic it is forwarding. Create a policy that enables ProxyProtocol support and attach it to the ALB using the AWS CLI.\n-  Configure the web server EC2 instances to only have private IP addresses.
