Which of the following is a reason why using this line is considered a bad practice? (_Alternative_: Why is using this line considered a bad practice?)\n\n```cpp\nusing namespace std;\n```\n\n-  The compiled code is always bigger because of all of the imported symbols.\n-  If the code uses a function defined in two different libraries with the same prototype but possibly with different implementations, there will be a compilation error due to ambiguity.\n-  It automatically includes all header files in the standard library (cstdint, cstdlib, cstdio, iostream, etc).\n-  It causes the compiler to enforce the exclusive inclusion of header files belonging to the standard library, generating compilation error when a different header file is included.\n\n[Reference](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/using-namespace-std-considered-bad-practice/)\n\n","options":3,"answer":1},{"text":"#### Q3.

Which of the following is a true statement about the difference between pointers and iterators?\n\n-  While pointers are variable that hold memory address, iterators are generic functions used to traverse containers. These function allows the programmer to implement read and write code as the container is traversed.\n-  Incrementing an iterator always means access the next element in the container(if any), no matter the container. Incrementing the pointer means pointing to the next element in memory, not always the next element.\n-  Pointers are variables that hold memory address where as iterator are unsigned integers that refers to offsets in arrays.\n-  All iterator are implemented with pointers so all iterators are pointers but not all pointers are iterators.\n\n[Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31128162)\n\n","options":3,"answer":1},{"text":"#### Q6.

Which of the following is not a difference between a class and a struct?\n\n-  Because structs are part of the C programming language, there are some complexity between C and C++ structs. This is not the case with classes.\n-  Classes may have member functions; structs are private.\n-  The default access specifier for members of struct is public, whereas for member of class, it is private.\n-  Template type parameters can be declared with classes, but not with the struct keyword.\n\nTemplates can be used with both classes and structs\n[Refernce](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/struct-cpp?view=msvc-170)\n[Reference](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/06/13/the-real-difference-between-struct-class/)\n\n","options":3,"answer":3},{"text":"#### Q10.

What does auto type specifier do in this line of code (since C++11)?\n\n```cpp\nauto x = 4000.22;\n```\n\n-  It specifies that the type of x will be deduced from the initializer - in this case, double.\n-  It specifies that the type of x is automatic meaning that if can be assigned different types of data throughout the program.\n-  It specifies that x is a variable with automatic storage duration.\n-  It specifies that more memory will be allocated for x in case it needs more space, avoiding loss of data due to overflow.\n\n","options":3,"answer":0},{"text":"#### Q13.

What is the main difference between these two Functions?\n\n```cpp\nstd::mutex::lock()\nstd::mutex::try_lock()\n```\n\n-  `lock()` has a higher privilege over `try_lock()`. This means that you have a better chance of acquiring a mutex `with lock()`.\n-  Both attempt to acquire a lock, but `lock()` blocks if the mutex is not available, whereas `try_lock()` returns whether the mutex is available or not.\n-  `lock()` enforces preemption, whereas `try_lock()` suggests preemption.\n-  If the mutex is not available, `try_lock()` returns with a corresponding code, whereas `lock()` snatches the mutex from the thread that currently has it.\n\nNote: variant of the question above.\n\n[Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/mutex/try_lock)\n\n","options":3,"answer":1},{"text":"#### Q62.

This may be achieved as a regular function call or as an exception.\n-  There are no destructors in C++.\n\n","options":3,"answer":0},{"text":"#### Q63. What is one benefit of declaring the parameter as a `const` reference instead of declaring it as a regular object?\n\n```cpp\nint calculateMedian(const my_array\u0026 a)\n```\n\n-  Actually, objects cannot be passed as regular variables, because they require a constructor call. Therefore, a `const` reference is the only way to pass class instances to functions.\n-  There are no benefits because a reference and an object are treated as the same thing.\n-  The `const` qualifier forbids the code to modify the argument, so the programmer can rest assured that the source object will remain unchanged. / Alt.: The argument is passed as a reference, so if the passed my_array object is large, the program will require less time and memory.\n-  The argument is passed as a reference, so the Function receives a copy that can be modified without affecting the original variable.\n\n[Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2627179/10773894)\n\n","options":3,"answer":2},{"text":"#### Q64.

Which choice is a reason to specify the type of a pointer instead of using `void *`, which works as a pointer to any type?\n\n-  The compiler needs the data type to make sure that the pointer is not going to be used on illegal non-pointable types such as functions, labels, pointers, and reference.\n-  `void *` does not work for any type. The language does not allow assigning anything other than `void` to a pointer to `void *`.\n-  The compiler needs the data type to know how much memory to allocate for the pointer, because different data types require different pointer lengths.\n-  Yes, it causes a compiler error because one field is defined as having a size of 0.\n\n[Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9802585/why-is-the-data-type-needed-in-pointer-declarations)\n\n","options":3,"answer":2},{"text":"#### Q70.
