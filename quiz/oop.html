Which type of inheritance must be used so that the resultant is hybrid?\n\n-  multiple\n-  any type of inheritance\n-  multilevel\n-  hierarchical\n\n\u003e Single Inheritance is where a derived class inherits properties and behaviour from a single base class. Example: Class A → Class B.\n\u003e Hierarchical Inheritance is where more than one derived class is created from a single base class. Example: Class A → Class B → Class C.\n\u003e Multiple Inheritance is for deriving a class from multiple base classes. Here, the child objects programmers create will have combined aspects of characteristics and features from multiple parent classes. These objects do follow their hierarchies of base classes.\n\u003e Multilevel Inheritance is where a child class is derived from another derived class. This feature carries combined aspects of multiple classes and follows their hierarchies.\n\u003e Hybrid Inheritance is a heterogeneous feature of using multiple inheritances. Here a child class is derived from one or more combinations of single, hierarchical, and multilevel inheritances. This inheritance is adopted for programs to mix different types of inheritance; for example, when mixing a single inheritance with multiple inheritances or maybe a situation when multiple inheritances are mixed within a single program.\n\n[reference](https://www.codingninjas.com/blog/2021/09/23/hybrid-inheritance-in-java)\n\n","options":3,"answer":0},{"text":"#### Q24.

Two classes combine private data members and provide public member functions to access and manipulate those data members. Where is abstraction used?\n\n-  Abstraction is using a private access specifier for the data members.\n-  Abstraction is using public member functions to access and manipulate the data members.\n-  Abstraction is using the class concept with both data members and member functions.\n-  There is insufficient information to decide where abstraction is being used.\n\n","options":3,"answer":1},{"text":"#### Q26.
