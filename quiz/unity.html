You can programmatically control audio effects, like Pitch and Reverb, from C# scripts using which feature of an Audio Mixer asset?\n\n-  audio attenuation\n-  exposed parameters\n-  ParamEQ\n-  Audio Mixer groups\n\nAudio attenuation is about energy loss, commonly refered to as \"gain\". ParamEQ allows you to change the frequency of the audio - \"pitch\", with no C# support. Audio Mixer groups do allow you to control audio effects, but not through C#.\n[Official Unity Tutorial:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tqi1aXlcpE)\n\n","options":3,"answer":1},{"text":"#### Q43. Multiple animations may be mixed together on a single character, selectively on different limbs. Which Mecanim feature supports this?\n\n-  Mip Maps\n-  avatar masks\n-  StateMachineBehaviour scripts\n-  animation events\n\nMip Maps are a technique that improves image quality and reduces rendering speed, at the cost of storage space, by including smaller copies of the image in the same file.
