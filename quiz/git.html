How can you check your current git version?\n\n- %OPTION% git --v\n- %OPTION% git --version\n- %OPTION% git --option\n- %OPTION% git --current\n\n","options":3,"answer":1},{"text":"#### Q2. What command lets you create a connection between a local and remote repository?\n\n- %OPTION% git remote add new\n- %OPTION% git remote add origin\n- %OPTION% git remote new origin\n- %OPTION% git remote origin\n\n[Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20291731/how-to-connect-to-a-remote-git-repository)\n\n","options":3,"answer":1},{"text":"#### Q3. Describe what these Git commands do to the commit history:\n\n```bash\ngit reset --hard HEAD~5\ngit merge --squash HEAD@{1}\n```\n\n- %OPTION% They reset the HEAD to the fifth commit in the repo, then merge to the master branch.\n- %OPTION% The current branch's HEAD is reset back five commits, then prior commits are squashed into a single commit.\n- %OPTION% They delete the last five commits.\n- %OPTION% They merge the last five commits into a new branch.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- `git reset --hard HEAD~5` resets the current branch to the commit just before the last 5 (see `man gitrevisions` for details about this notation and other cool alternatives like `HEAD@{2 days ago}`). As it is a hard reset, it will also overwrite every change in the working tree as well. See `man git-reset`.\n- `git merge --squash HEAD@{1}` HEAD@{1} is where the branch was just before the previous command (again, see `man gitrevisions`). This command sets the state of the index to be as it would just after a merge from that commit. This whole operation could be a way to take 5 commits from a branch in which you started a new feature and squash them to a single commit, a meaningful one.\n\n","options":3,"answer":1},{"text":"#### Q4. Your current project has several branches; master, beta, and push-notifications. You've just finished the notification feature in the push-notification branch, and you want to commit it to beta branch. How can you accomplish this?\n\n- %OPTION% Checkout the push-notifications branch and run git merge beta\n- %OPTION% Checkout the master branch and run git merge beta -\u003e push-notification\n- %OPTION% Delete the push-notification branch and it will be committed to the master branch automatically\n- %OPTION% Checkout the beta branch and run git merge push-notification\n\n","options":3,"answer":3},{"text":"#### Q5. Which of the following is true you when you use the following command?\n\n`git add -A`\n\n- %OPTION% All new and updated files are staged\n- %OPTION% Files are staged in alphabetical order.\n- %OPTION% All new files are staged\n- %OPTION% Only updated files are staged\n\n","options":3,"answer":0},{"text":"#### Q6. What will the following command print to the Terminal?\n\n`git remote -v`\n\n- %OPTION% A list of remote repositories and their URLs\n- %OPTION% The current git version you're running\n- %OPTION% An inline editor for modifying remote repositories\n- %OPTION% The last 5 git versions you've installed\n\n","options":3,"answer":0},{"text":"#### Q7. Looking at the following commands, describe what is happening.\n\n```bash\ngit checkout feature-user-location\ngit cherry-pick kj2342134sdf090093f0sdgasdf99sdfo992mmmf9921231\n```\n\n- %OPTION% The commit is being tagged for release on the feature-user-location branch\n- %OPTION% A commit is being copied from its original branch over to the feature-user-location branch\n- %OPTION% The commit is being cherry picked as the new HEAD of the commit history\n- %OPTION% A commit is being copied from the feature-user-location branch to the master branch\n- %OPTION% The branch is switched to the feature-user-location branch, and the specified commit is applied to the branch.\n\n**Explanation:** Commits aren't copied when cherry picking, they are cherry picked. The changes introduced by the commit are applied and a new commit is then created. This allow us to get specific changes as if they were patches (in the GIT's book, this is actually called [Patching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C:-Git-Commands-Patching \"See this in the GIT's book\")).
