Default Transaction behavior rolls back on validation exception but commits on proper validation\n-  It creates a proxy that implements the same interface(s) as the annotated class, allowing Spring to inject behaviors before, after, or around method calls into the object being proxied.\n-  It's a transaction that must be actively validated by Spring's `TransactionValidator` class using Spring's transaction validation code. Default Transaction behavior rolls back on validation exception.\n\n","options":3,"answer":2},{"text":"#### Q12.
